          Data analysts use data to perform reporting and direct analysis.
          Whereas data scientists and engineers typically interact with data in
          its raw or unrefined states, analysts work with data that’s already
          been cleaned and transformed into more user-friendly formats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the challenge they’re trying to solve or address, their
          analysis may be descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data analysts are often responsible for maintaining dashboards,
          generating reports, preparing data visualizations, and using data to
          forecast or guide business activity.
