      <h1>Data Engineer</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Data engineers are responsible for finding trends in data sets and
          developing algorithms to help make raw data more useful to the
          enterprise
        </li>
        <li>
          Data engineers are often responsible for building algorithms to help
          give easier access to raw data
        </li>
        <li>
          Data engineers also need to understand how to optimize data retrieval
          and how to develop dashboards, reports and other visualizations for
          stakeholders. Depending on the organization, data engineers may also
          be responsible for communicating data trends.

      </ul>

      <h3>Data Engineer Roles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Generalist: Data engineers wear many hats as one of the few
          “data-focused” people in the company. Responsible for every step of
          the data process, from managing data to analyzing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pipeline-centric: Data engineers work alongside data scientists to
          help make use of the data they collect. Pipeline-centric data
          engineers need “in-depth knowledge of distributed systems and computer
          science,” according to Dataquest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Database-centric: Data engineers focus on analytics databases, work
          with data warehouses across multiple databases and develop table
          schemas.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Data Engineer Responsbilities</h3>
      <p>
        Data engineers are tasked with managing and organizing data, while also
        keeping an eye out for trends or inconsistencies that will impact
        business goals
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the most common responsibilities for a data engineer include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop, construct, test and maintain architectures</li>
        <li>Align architecture with business requirements</li>
        <li>Data acquisition</li>
        <li>Develop data set processes</li>
      </ul>
    </>
