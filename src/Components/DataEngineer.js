          Data engineers are responsible for designing, building, and
          maintaining datasets that can be leveraged in data projects. As such,
          they closely work with both data scientists and data analysts.
        </li>
        <li>
          {' '}
          Much of the work data engineers perform is related to preparing the
          infrastructure and ecosystem that the data team and organization rely
          on.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, data engineers collect and integrate data from various
          sources, build data platforms for use by other data team members, and
          optimize and maintain the data warehouse.
        </li>
      </ul>
