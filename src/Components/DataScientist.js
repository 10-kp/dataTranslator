      <p> One of the 3 pilars of Data analytics</p>

      <p>
        Data scientists play an integral role on the analytics team. These
        professionals leverage advanced mathematics, programming, and tools
        (such as statistical modeling, machine learning, and artificial
        intelligence) to perform large-scale analysis. While their role and
        responsibilities vary from organization to organization, data scientists
        typically perform work designed to inform and shape data projects. They
        may, for example, identify challenges that can be addressed with a data
        project or data sources to collect for future use. Much of their time is
        spent designing algorithms and models to mine and organize data.
