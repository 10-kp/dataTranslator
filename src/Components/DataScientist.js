          Data scientists play an integral role on the analytics team. These
          professionals leverage advanced mathematics, programming, and tools
          (such as statistical modeling, machine learning, and artificial
          intelligence) to perform large-scale analysis.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          While their role and responsibilities vary from organization to
          organization, data scientists typically perform work designed to
          inform and shape data projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          They may, for example, identify challenges that can be addressed with
          a data project or data sources to collect for future use. Much of
          their time is spent designing algorithms and models to mine and
          organize data.
