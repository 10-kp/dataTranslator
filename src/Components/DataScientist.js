      <h3 class='gap'>Data Scientist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the 3 pilars of Data analytics</li>
        <li>
          Data scientists play an integral role on the analytics team. These
          professionals leverage advanced mathematics, programming, and tools
          (such as statistical modeling, machine learning, and artificial
          intelligence) to perform large-scale analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data scientists are responsible for discovering insights from massive
          amounts of structured and unstructured data to help shape or meet
          specific business needs and goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          A data scientist’s main objective is to organize and analyze large
          amounts of data, often using software specifically designed for the
          task. The final results of a data scientist’s analysis needs to be
          easy enough for all invested stakeholders to understand
        </li>

        <li>
          The data that data scientists analyze, often called big data, draws
          from a number of sources. There are two types of data that fall under
          the umbrella of big data: structured data and unstructured data.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Structured data is organized, typically by categories that make it
              easy for a computer to sort, read and organize automatically. Some
              examples are Website traffic data, sales figures, bank accounts or
              GPS coordinates collected by your smartphone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unstructured data, the fastest growing form of big data, is more
              likely to come from human input — customer reviews, emails,
              videos, social media posts, etc. This data is typically more
              difficult to sort through and less efficient to manage with
              technology.

      <h3>Data Scientist Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Top five skills for data scientists include a mix of hard and soft
        skills:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Programming: A fundamental Data Scientist’s skill set. Helps improves
          statistics skills,analyze large datasets and ability to create tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quantitative analysis: An important skill for analyzing large
          datasets, Improves the ability to run experimental analysis, scale
          data strategy and help implement machine learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Product intuition: Understanding products assists in performing
          quantitative analysis, predict system behavior, establish metrics and
          improve debugging skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communication: Important soft skills that helps leverage the skills
          listed above.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teamwork: Much like communication, teamwork is vital. It requires
          being selfless, embracing feedback and sharing your knowledge with the
          team.
        </li>
